# Twitter_sentiment_analysis

In sentiment analysis, positive tweets and negative tweets are typically determined based on the tone, emotion, or context conveyed in the text. Here's a general guideline:

# Positive Tweets:
Tweets that express happiness, gratitude, excitement, or enthusiasm.
# Examples:
"This is the best product I've ever used! Highly recommend it!"
"Feeling so happy and grateful today. Life is good!"
"Great match! Well played, team!"
"Thank you for the amazing support, you guys are awesome!"

# Negative Tweets:
Tweets that show anger, frustration, disappointment, or sadness.
# Examples:
"This service is terrible. I’m so frustrated!"
"Feeling really down today. Nothing is going right."
"The product broke after one day. Total waste of money."
"This was the worst decision I ever made."

# Key Indicators for Classification
# Words or Phrases:

Positive: amazing, happy, fantastic, love, great, excellent.
Negative: bad, horrible, disappointed, terrible, hate, poor.
Emojis:

Positive: 😊, ❤️, 🎉, 👍.
Negative: 😡, 💔, 👎, 😢.

# Contextual Polarity:

The classification often uses pre-trained models or custom classifiers trained on labeled datasets where tweets are tagged as "positive" or "negative" based on such cues.
